# Intel_Unnati_EDUAI  

**Intel_Unnati_EDUAI** is an AI-powered personalized learning system designed for **K-12 students**. The project focuses on predicting **assessment scores, determining promotion eligibility, and recommending customized study materials** based on individual student performance.  

By leveraging machine learning, data analysis, and NLP, the system dynamically curates study content, ensuring adaptive and effective learning. It analyzes key factors such as study habits, IQ levels, material difficulty, and past assessments to provide tailored recommendations, helping students improve their academic outcomes.  

With AI-driven insights, EDUAI enhances engagement, making learning more interactive, efficient, and student-centric. The platform ensures that each student receives the right resources at the right time, promoting better understanding and academic success.


### **Project Description**  

The project consists of multiple Python scripts, each serving a specific function to facilitate decision-making in education. Below is a brief description of each file:  

- **`main.py`** – This script determines whether a particular action (such as promoting a student) should be executed or not. It serves as the entry point for running the program using `python main.py`.  

- **`predict_studymat.py`** – This file is responsible for predicting the appropriate study materials based on predefined criteria. It helps in selecting the most suitable learning resources for students.  

- **`keep_skip_material.py`** – This script processes study materials based on the student's academic level. It ensures that students receive content that matches their proficiency and learning needs.  

- **`generate_teaching_material.py`** – This module dynamically generates teaching materials tailored to different educational requirements. It plays a crucial role in providing adaptive learning content.

- - **`checkcapability.py`** – This script conducts an assessment to evaluate a student's capability and determines whether they should be promoted to the next level. 

Together, these scripts create a structured approach to personalized learning by making data-driven decisions on study materials and student progression.
